      <p>If this pandemic has done anything to me, it’s made me want to travel a <strong>lot</strong> more than I ever have before. These past few months of restlessness culminated in a trip to Yosemite and Joshua Tree National Parks in California with a few friends, a repreive that allowed for a socially-distanced adventure and a pinch of serenity during a period of our lives that is anyting but.</p>

      <h2><a class="header-link" href="/learning/2020/10/20/powershell-qlik-cli.html">Learning PowerShell by using Qlik CLI</a></h2>
      <p>The more I use Qlik Sense, the more I realize that the real power of it comes from the use of its APIs under the hood. While the QMC is a powerful admin console, the ability to write programs using the Qlik Sense API can push the boundaries of what’s possible with Qlik. I recently had a project where I needed to save all of the apps and data connections in a client’s environment so that we could un- and then re-install Qlik to complete a network update. Turns out that a great way to accomplish this with the Qlik APIs is to script it out using the Qlik CLI tool in PowerShell.</p>

      <p>I recently had a project requirement that involved needing to encode a few strings in Base64 to be sent over a REST API call. As happens often during projects, I was able to find a different solution that precluded the need for lots of Qlik script…but I had already started, so I just went ahead and finished it!</p>
