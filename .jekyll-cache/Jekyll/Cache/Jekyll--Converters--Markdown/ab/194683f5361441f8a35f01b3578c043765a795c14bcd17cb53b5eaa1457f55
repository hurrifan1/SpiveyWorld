I"Q<p>The more I use Qlik Sense, the more I realize that the real power of it comes from the use of its APIs under the hood. While the QMC is a powerful admin console, the ability to write programs using the Qlik Sense API can push the boundaries of what’s possible with Qlik. I recently had a project where I needed to save all of the apps and data connections in a client’s environment so that we could un- and then re-install Qlik to complete a network update. Turns out that a great way to accomplish this with the Qlik APIs is to script it out using the Qlik CLI tool in PowerShell.</p>
